# Article Titles

## General Rules

- A translated or transliterated name is considered a different name. [[Prometheus]] and [[Προμηθεύς]] are different names.
- The article title usually consists of the first name and the last name only. We use "[[Maximilien Robespierre]]" instead of "Maximilien François Marie Isidore de Robespierre".
- For French names with "de", "la", "le", "des", etc, we usually use "de Lafayette" instead of "de la Fayette", "Descartes" instead of "des Cartes".

## Translating Names

- For Japanese names, we put family name first and given name last.
- For Chinese names, we put family name first and given name last, and no hyphen inside any part.
- For Korean names, we put family name first and given name last.
