This is the contribution guidelines of NamesDB.

# Meta

Unless someone explicitly specifies its gender, we address it with neuter pronouns ("it", "its", and "itself"). We try to avoid using pronouns to refer to Homo sapiens.

# Using GitHub

## Editing

Now, the database is hosted on GitHub Pages, thus all changes are supposed to be submitted to the database through a pull request on GitHub. The repository page of NamesDB is <a href="http://github.com/namesdb/namesdb.github.io">http://github.com/namesdb/namesdb.github.io</a>.

GitHub has <a href="https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/">articles</a> to help users to better understand the workflow on GitHub.

## Discussion

Most discussions are supposed to happen in the <a href="https://github.com/namesdb/namesdb.github.io/issues">issues list</a> of the corresponding repository on GitHub.

## Becoming A Moderator

We certainly need moderators to organize discussions and review pull requests.

For now, if you have at least 4 valid edits on NamesDB, you may become a moderator. We usually don't need more than 10 moderators.

If you would like to become a moderator, create an issue.

# Name Popularity

We hardly include unpopular names and unpopular users of popular names. Our primary goal is to collect names in fictions which are at least moderately popular. Fictions include mythologies, folklores, novels, anime, games, etc.

Popular real persons are welcomed.

# Article Titles

## General Rules

- This community is in English, but many of the names are not.
- There are names that don't fit the common first-last or first-middle-last structure. When we deal with names structured other like, we need to discuss and decide language-by-language.
- The article title usually consists of the first name and the last name only. We use "[[Maximilien Robespierre]]" instead of "Maximilien François Marie Isidore de Robespierre". [[WP:EN:Martin Luther]] the reformer is indexed in [[Martin Luther]], and [[WP:EN:Martin Luther King Jr]] the civil rights activist is indexed in [[Martin King]].
- For the people who have nick names, the nick names are considered different names. [[James Raynor]] and [[Jim Raynor]] are different names, though someone holds them both.
- A translated or transliterated name is considered a different name. [[Prometheus]] and [[Προμηθεύς]] are different names.
- For the people who have different names for different lingual groups like [[WP:EN:Jack Ma]], his canonical names and their translation/transliterations are considered different names. "[[Jack Ma]]", "[[Ma Yun]]", "[[马云]]", and "[[杰克·马]]" are all different names.
- For French names with "de", "la", "le", "des", etc, we usually use "de Lafayette" instead of "de la Fayette", "Descartes" instead of "des Cartes".
- For someone commonly addressed by part of the canonical name and a decorator (e.g. a title) like "Jeanne d'Arc", we usually use the canonical name. If the last name or the first name of the person is unknown or is controversial, we omit the part and only address the person with the confirmed part of the canonical name, like "Jeanne". If a name comes controversial, citations are needed in determining how we address the person.
- For the names in certain cultural groups where people's own names are usually accompanied with a single member or multiple members in the the person's binary tree of recursive ancestors like "Δευκαλίων, γιος του Προμηθεύς" (Deucalion, son of Prometheus), we only address the person with the the person's own name, like "Δευκαλίων".

## Translating/Transliterating Names

- When translating/transliterating Japanese names, we put family name first and given name last. "[[Emiya Kiritsugu]]" instead of "Kiritsugu Emiya".
- When translating/transliterating Chinese names, we put family name first and given name last, and no hyphen inside any part. "[[Jiang Zemin]]" instead of "Jiang Ze-Min" or "Ze-Min Jiang".
- When translating/transliterating Korean names, we put family name first and given name last.
- When translating/transliterating Latin names into Chinese, we use "·" (MIDDLE DOT, Unicode: U+00B7, UTF-8: C2 B7) to divide the first name and the last name.
- If a name has multiple sources, e.g. "李" the Chinese family name sometimes transliterates to "Lee", which is identical to "Lee" the western family name, all sources are considered equal.
- If a person, who aligns to China or the Chinese languages, doesn't explicitly specific how its name is supposed to be transliterated into the Latin alphabet, we transliterate the person's name according to [[WP:EN:Pinyin]], the official romanization standard of the Chinese languages in People's Republic of China.
- For unspecified languages, we align to Wikipedia's standards by default.
